# Bank Churn Prediction: Hackathon Barcelona 2nd Place
Take a look at the project: https://github.com/CeloCruz/BankChurn/blob/main/Bank%20churn%20prediction.ipynb

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Bank Churn Prediction Project repository! This project, which achieved the second-place ranking in a hackathon competition in Barcelona, focuses on analyzing customer churn within a bank and building predictive models to identify potential churners. The project encompasses the construction and evaluation of various classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.

**Objective**: Understand and address the issue of customer churn, which can have a significant impact on a bank's bottom line. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them

**Description**: 
Focused on customer churn within a bank, this project's aim was to build predictive models for identifying potential churners and facilitating proactive customer retention. It entailed comprehensive data exploration, analysis of customer attributes, and churn distribution. Multiple classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, were constructed and optimized. Notably, gradient boosting excelled as the top performer. Key skills utilized encompass data transformation, analysis, preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization, and machine learning. The project's transparent repository provides Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and datasets as a valuable resource for addressing customer churn in banking.
