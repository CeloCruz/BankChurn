# Bank Churn Prediction Project
Welcome to the Bank Churn Prediction Project repository! This project, which achieved the second-place ranking in a hackathon competition in Barcelona, focuses on analyzing customer churn within a bank and building predictive models to identify potential churners. The project encompasses the construction and evaluation of various classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.

## Project Overview
In this data science project, we aim to understand and address the issue of customer churn, which can have a significant impact on a bank's bottom line. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them. Here's a brief overview of the project:

* Data Exploration: We start by exploring the dataset, gaining insights into customer attributes, and understanding the distribution of churn and non-churn cases.

* Model Building: We build multiple classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to predict customer churn. Each model is optimized using RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

* Model Evaluation: We assess the performance of these models using a validation test to ensure their effectiveness on unseen data.

* Comparison: We conduct an evaluation test on a separate dataset to compare the model performances. Notably, the gradient boosting model emerges as the top performer, exhibiting superior precision and F1-score in both tests.

## Repository Contents
Code: This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Datasets: You can find the datasets used for this analysis in the 'data' directory. We provide both the training and evaluation datasets for transparency.

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

* Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.

* Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. We welcome collaboration and feedback.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project highlights the potential of the gradient boosting model as a valuable tool for predicting customer churn rates in a bank. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can proactively identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling the bank to implement strategies for customer retention.

We hope you find this project informative and useful. Please don't hesitate to explore the code, datasets, and documentation. Your contributions and feedback are highly appreciated.
